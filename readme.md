#Work Area for predicting Forest Cover Types (Kaggle)
This is my repo for hosting code and data for the Forest Cover Type prediction challenge provided by Kaggle. I will likely use some of this content to create blog posts (if I come up with something interesting) to share what I've learnt. 

Feel free to use this for your own reference or learning. Just clone the repo or download the .ipynb files. The IPython notebooks can also be viewed online below:
